# Chaotic-Dynamical-Systems

This is a project to learn about chaotic dynamical systems.
Robert L. Devaney's book A First Course in Chaotic Dynamical Systems (1992) is used as a theoretical guidance.
The theory in the book is tested and played with to produce insightful visualisations.
So far, MATLAB is used for programming.
